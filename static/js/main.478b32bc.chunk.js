The algorithms developed are recolour based on a certain function. The inverse, desaturate based on HSV colour and inverse RGB  are all based on a data structure commonly used in compression which splits the image into quadrants and if the quadrant does not consist of the same colour the quadrant is split again until a block of the same colour is present.
